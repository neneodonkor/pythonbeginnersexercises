Sharing my experience as I learn Python.

These are exercise I am attempting as I master the concepts of Python.
I am sharing these code snippets to encourage others.

For those who are more experienced, feel free to offer advice. Please don't
be mean. I recognize that my code may look amateurish but I am willing to
learn.
